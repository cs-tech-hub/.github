## 🌟 Vision

CS‑TECH‑HUB exists to build a collaborative ecosystem where software craftsmanship meets modern engineering disciplines—merging AI, cloud-native architectures, performance, security, and developer experience (DX) into production‑ready open solutions.

## 🧭 Mission Statement

1. Architect scalable, resilient, maintainable platforms & tooling.  
2. Accelerate builders with reusable modules, templates & frameworks.  
3. Reduce complexity via clean architecture & documentation excellence.  
4. Promote open learning: mentorship, workshops, public knowledge artifacts.  
5. Foster a respectful, inclusive engineering culture.

## 🗺 Roadmap (High-Level 4-Stage Flow)

1. Foundation: Monorepo / multi-repo strategy, shared contracts, unified CI/CD.  
2. Enablement: Developer onboarding portal, scaffolding CLI, automated doc pipelines.  
3. Intelligence: AI-powered coding assistants, release risk scoring, AIOps signals.  
4. Scale & Governance: Policy-as-code, chaos engineering playbooks, cost insights dashboards.

> A living roadmap will be maintained in a dedicated `roadmap.md` or GitHub Projects board.

## 📘 Documentation Strategy

| Doc Type | Purpose | Location |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| README | High-level orientation | Root / each repo |
| ADR (Architecture Decision Record) | Trace major decisions | `docs/decisions` |
| API Specs | Service contracts (OpenAPI / GraphQL SDL) | `services/*/spec` |
| Runbooks | Operational & incident reference | `docs/playbooks` |
| Onboarding | Step-by-step environment setup | `docs/onboarding.md` |
| Security Guidelines | Secure coding patterns | `docs/security/` |
| Contribution Guide | Standards & workflow | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |

---

## ✅ Engineering Quality Guardrails

- Semantic commits + automated changelogs (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` …)
- Enforced PR checks: tests, lint, type check, build, security scan
- Code owners for critical domains
- Performance & load budgets (benchmarks gated)
- Observability first: traces + logs + metrics in first PR
- ADR required for cross-cutting or irreversible decisions
- Branch protection: signed commits optional (recommend)

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance (Baseline)

| Area | Practice |
|------|---------|
| Dependencies | Dependabot updates + license review |
| Code | CodeQL + secret scanning + static analysis |
| Images | Vulnerability scan (Trivy) pre‑merge |
| Artifacts | (Optional) Sigstore signing, SBOM (CycloneDX) generation |
| Access | Principle of least privilege / short-lived tokens |
| Incident | Security response runbook + contact alias |

Add a `SECURITY.md` for disclosure instructions (responsible vulnerability reporting channel).

---

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork or create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/awesome-improvement`)  
2. Run setup script (e.g. `pnpm bootstrap` / `make init`)  
3. Follow commit convention (Conventional Commits)  
4. Include tests & docs for behavior changes  
5. Open PR with:
   - Context / Problem
   - Proposed Solution
   - Trade-offs
   - Screenshots (UI change)
6. Await automated checks + at least 1 reviewer approval

> See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed style, naming & review guidelines.

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

| Layer | Focus | Tooling (Example) |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| Unit | Pure functions / domain logic | Vitest / Jest / Go test |
| Integration | Module boundaries & adapters | Supertest / Testcontainers |
| Contract | API / schema compatibility | OpenAPI diff / Pact |
| E2E | User journeys | Playwright / Cypress |
| Performance | Latency, throughput, tail % | k6 + Prometheus |
| Security | Static + dynamic | CodeQL, ZAP / OWASP checks |

---

## 📊 Metrics & Observability (MVP Goals)

- P95 latency per service
- Error rate & saturation (RED + USE)
- Deployment frequency / MTTR
- Build time & test suite wall clock
- Security issues aging

> Introduce quality scorecards/dashboards in Grafana or GitHub Insights.

| 3 | PR assistant (risk & complexity score) | Faster, safer reviews |
| 4 | Drift detection (config, schema) | Reduced production surprises |
| 5 | Release note auto-generation | Time savings + accuracy |

---

## 🗣 Community & Culture
